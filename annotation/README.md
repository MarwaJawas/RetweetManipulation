# The labeling process is performed based on two criteria.
First, categorizing the retweeter groups based on their behaviors in retweeting in hashtag. If the retweeter group is retweeting a large number of retweets,
the group is labeled as malicious. This feature can be measured by computing
weighted degree from retweeter graph. When the weighted degrees between
retweeters in group are high, this evidence to malicious retweeting behavior
among them.
