##This repository contains the source code of my master's thesis titled (Structures of Retweets Manipulation on Twitter: Case Study of Trending Topics in Saudi Arabia)
 you can find it in this link in [Thesis] ("https://kausp.sa/Details/Thesis/146506/")

I developed a new method that detects fake retweeter's based on their Twitter's connection. It consists of 4 components: <br>
<ol>
<li> collecting data Using Twitter API </li>
<li> extracting data and building a database </li> 
<li> building a graph based on user's retweeting activity </li>
<li> extract some features: temporal, profile,  connection in the network </li>
</ol>
Finally, that results in predict fake retweeters based on top important feature.  <br>
All code with Python
