I developed a new method that detects fake retweeter's based on their Twitter's connection. It consists from 4 compontent: <br>
<ol>
<li> collecting data Using Twitter API </li>
<li> extracting data and building a database </li> 
<li> building graph based on user's retweeting activity </li>
<li> extract some features: temporal, profile,  connection in the network </li>
</ol>
Finally, that results in predict fake retweeters based on top important feature  <br>
